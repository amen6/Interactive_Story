## Description
Zohal, is a game that takes place in space, the heroine of the game is "Zohal", and she is an astronaut who was sent on a mission to one of the space stations, but upon reaching the station they received an attack from aliens, and "Zohal" remained the only survivor looking for a way to survive.

## What's The Concept
The goal is to maintain the oxygen level, find a way to return to Earth, and survive by warning humans of aliens.
You lose the game if you run out of oxygen, or if you can't dodge the alien attacks.
